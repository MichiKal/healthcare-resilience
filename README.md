# Stress-testing the resilience of the Austrian healthcare system using agent-based simulation

We use an agent-based model to simulate shocks to the healthcare system by randomly removing doctors from the underlying network. The repository contains the codes used for [paper].

## Contents
The repository contains two folders: ```Code``` contains necessary script to run the simulation and arrive at the results and ```Figures``` containing the Figures used in the paper.
In ```Code``` you will find the scripts and 3 folders for data, results and figures necessary to run the code. An additional ```README``` in this folder gives detailed information about the ordering of the scripts to run. 

The ```Figures``` folder does not contain Figure 1 since it was created using screenshots of a visualisation webpage of an accompanying project.

## Requirements
To run the script you will need Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
